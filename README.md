## Object Calisthenics 

I will follow Object Calisthenics to solve this problem. Object Calisthenics are programming exercises, formalized as a set of 9 rules invented by Jeff Bay in his book The ThoughWorks Anthology. 
These rules focus on maintainability, readability, testability, and comprehensibility of your code. These are the rules:

1. Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
2. Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword
3. Wrap All Primitives And Strings
4. First Class Collections
5. One Dot Per Line
6. Don’t Abbreviate
7. Keep All Entities Small
8. No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables
9. No Getters/Setters/Properties
